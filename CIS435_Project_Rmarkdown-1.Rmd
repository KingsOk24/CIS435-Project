Description of Project:
  This project will give a detailed analysis of data breaches in cybersecurity in the United States of America spanning from 2009 to 2014. This analysis will cover the number of breaches, the name of the business or entity breached. The state in which the breach took place.  The person or business involved or responsible for the breach. the number of people affected by the breach, and the date the breach took place.
  
Data Set:

Date of Breach: This describes when the breach of data occured for the company in question and the date is siginficant on the being able to track on different plots certain patterns dealing with other columns in the data set.

Type of Breach: This describes what type of breach the company in question was expericeing and this is useful for trends with how many companies had similar breaches and how those companies connect with other data records in the set.

Date Posted: This describes what date the breach was posted and made note to the public and it gives trends on what expect next time an attack like this occurs and how to reduce these trends for future attacks.

Summary: This breaks down a breif overview of what happened in the event in question.

Year: This talks about the years which these events occured and it is siginifcant to the data to look at future trends in the years to come and give a prediction what is likely to happen again if these events were to occur.

Questions:

Questions 1: Does the amount of breaches have a positive correlation with the continuous variable time?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
